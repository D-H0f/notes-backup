***what is docker***:
	Docker is virtualization software.
	A replacement for running software in virtual machines. where a VM virtualizes hardware, docker virtualizes an OS environment
	packages application with all the necessary dependencies, configuration, system tools and runtime.
***docker vs virtual machine***:
	on a computer, there are three layers. hardware layer, kernal layer, and application layer. a virtual machine virtualizes a new kernal for each environment, while a docker container virtualizes multiple application layers on the same kernal. This means docker containers are faster to start, easier to copy and share, and take up less disk space, at the cost of only being able to run containers on compatable operating systems.
