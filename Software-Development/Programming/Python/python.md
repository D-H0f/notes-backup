Python is a high level, general purpose interpreted language.

**Statements and control flow**
list of [[statement]]s in python include:
The assignment statement, using a single equals sign "="
The [[if]] statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif
The [[for]] statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
The [[while]] statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true
The [[try]] statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by [[except]] clauses. it also ensures that clean-up code in a [[finally]] block is always run regardless of how the block exits
The [[raise]] statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception
The [[class]] statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in [[object oriented]] programming
The [[def]] statement, which defines a [[function]] or [[method]]
The [[with]] statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization like behavior and replacing a common [[try]]/[[finally]] idiom for things like opening and writing to files.
The [[break]] statement, which exits a loop
The [[continue]] statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next
The [[del]] statement, which removes a variable, deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined
The [[pass]] statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block
The [[assert]] statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply
The [[yield]] statement, which returns a value from a [[generator]] function (and also an operator); used to implement [[coroutines]]
The [[return]] statement, used to return a value from a [[function]]
The [[import]] and [[from]] statements, used to import modules whose [[function]]s or [[variable]]s can be used in the current program
